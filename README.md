## Project Intro

With recent advancements in AI, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between human versus 
AI-generated content, which creates challenges in verifying content authenticity. This presents concerns in 
domains such as education, news, and social media where content authenticity is crucial. This project aims to 
address this issue by comparing the performance of multiple deep learning models in a binary classification 
task (i.e., human versus AI-generated text).

As part of this project, we will develop and train a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network model, as 
well as a custom transformer model using the PyTorch machine learning framework. Additionally, we will also use 
a pretrained DistilBERT transformer model to provide a comprehensive performance comparison across multiple 
model architectures.

Following model selection, we plan to develop an interactive web application that allows users to input text 
and receive predictions on whether it was human or AI-generated, along with the associated probability. An 
application such as this can be used in the real-world for educators, content moderators, and the general public 
to combat some of the aforementioned growing concerns.
